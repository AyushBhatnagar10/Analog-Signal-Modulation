üî≠ Overview
The Signal Modulation Simulator is an educational tool designed to help students and enthusiasts understand the fundamental concepts of signal modulation techniques. It provides a real-time visualization of how carrier signals are modulated by message signals using different methods:

Amplitude Modulation (AM): Changes the amplitude of the carrier wave
Frequency Modulation (FM): Changes the frequency of the carrier wave
Phase Modulation (PM): Changes the phase of the carrier wave

By manipulating various parameters, users can observe the effects on the resulting modulated signal and gain intuitive understanding of these important communication concepts.

üîß Technical Details
This project is built entirely with vanilla front-end technologies:

HTML5: Structured semantic markup for the application
CSS3: Modern styling with flexbox layout, CSS variables, gradients, and animations
JavaScript: Canvas API for drawing waveforms and managing simulation state
No Dependencies: Zero external libraries or frameworks

The waveforms are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API, with mathematical calculations performed in real-time to generate accurate representations of each signal type.

üìä Mathematical Implementation

The simulator implements the following mathematical equations for each modulation type:

Amplitude Modulation (AM)
x_AM(t) = A_c √ó (1 + Œº √ó cos(2œÄ √ó f_m √ó t)) √ó cos(2œÄ √ó f_c √ó t)
where Œº = A_m/A_c is the modulation index.

Frequency Modulation (FM)
x_FM(t) = A_c √ó cos(2œÄ √ó f_c √ó t + Œ≤ √ó sin(2œÄ √ó f_m √ó t))
where Œ≤ = (K_f √ó A_m)/f_m is the modulation index.

Phase Modulation (PM)
x_PM(t) = A_c √ó cos(2œÄ √ó f_c √ó t + K_p √ó m(t))
where m(t) = A_m √ó cos(2œÄ √ó f_m √ó t) is the message signal.


üìñ How to Use

Select a modulation type from the dropdown menu (AM, FM, or PM)
Adjust the parameters using the sliders:

Carrier Amplitude (Ac): Controls the height of the carrier signal
Message Amplitude (Am): Controls the height of the message signal
Carrier Frequency (fc): Controls how many cycles of the carrier signal occur per second
Message Frequency (fm): Controls how many cycles of the message signal occur per second
FM Sensitivity (Kf): (For FM only) Controls how much the frequency changes
PM Sensitivity (Kp): (For PM only) Controls how much the phase changes


Click "Start Simulation" to begin the animation
Use "Reset" to reset the time parameter
Observe the waveforms and how changes in parameters affect the modulated signal
